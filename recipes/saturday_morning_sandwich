# Saturday Morning Sandwich
by Kevin Beck
Cooking time ~20-30 Minutes

## About This

At one point in the year, I weighed 240 pounds - I looked like the national treasure who is Jack Black. I've since lost almost 20 of those pounds this quarter, but can enjoy a nice meal on a Saturday morning. 

My favorite breakfast to do on these splurge days is my "Saturday Morning Sandwich" - a breakfast sandwich I perfected during COVID. It combines some different cuisines across the US from New York to Carolina. 

## Ingredients

- 2 large eggs
- 6 slices salami
- 2 teaspoons barbecue sauce
- 2 slices dairy-free cheese
- 1 teaspoon Earth Balance
- Everything bagel seasoning
- 1 gluten-free bagel

## Instructions

Prepare a saucepan or frying pan by greasing it with the Earth Balance spread to ensure lubrication. (Mechanical engineers, rise up!)

Wait until the buttery spread has started sizzling and then place the eggs on the saucepan, sunny-side up. Cook the eggs to over-easy.

Cut the bagel into halves. Place everything bagel seasoning and barbecue sauce on the bagel. Once barbecue sauce is on, place cheese and salami, divided evenly, on each bagel slice.

Once eggs are cooked, place the eggs on top of the salami-cheese assembly. 

If preferred, break egg yolks.
