#  Daytona Puffs
Many of you today may know me as a water polo goalie, but several years ago, I was a competitive swimmer. Swimmers often need quick bursts of energy for an event that lasts five minutes or less, and my signature swim meet snack was the "Daytona puff", named after the Daytona 500 motor race. These same Daytona Puffs may be used at water polo tournaments next season. 
### Ingredients (Makes 16)
- 1 cup oats
- 1 tablespoon sunflower butter
- 1 tablespoon water
- 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips
- 1 teaspoon pea protein powder
- 1 teaspoon honey

### Instructions
1. Place oats, protein powder, and honey in a bowl.
2. Mix ingredients through kneading and folding until they stick.
3. Add sunflower butter until honey and sunflower butter are homogeneous.
4. Fold in chocolate chips. 
5. If still not sticking, add water until mixture adheres.
6. Divide mixture into golf ball-size spheres. 
7. Place in refrigerator for 20-30 minutes.
8. Place in a plastic bag to take to your next sporting competition!

Athletes of all ages and sizes can enjoy the quick energy burst of Daytona Puffs and feel the adrenaline!
